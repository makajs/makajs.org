Verdaccio relies on `yarn` instead `npm` to download depenedencies.

*Note: the current build only will build with `âžœ yarn` latest.*

```

## Scripts

We have a list of scripts that you will use for diferent kind of tasks, in the following section we describe all posible task based on branches.

### Branch (2.x)

On branch `2.x` the unique part we have to build is the UI which is based on React.js, webpack and CSS Modules.
