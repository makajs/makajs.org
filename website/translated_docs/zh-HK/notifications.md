Notify was built primarily to use with Slack's Incoming webhooks, but will also deliver a simple payload to any endpoint. Currently only active for `publish` / `create` commands.

## Usage

An example with a **hipchat** hook:

#### Single notification

```yaml
notify:
  method: POST
  headers: [{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}]
  endpoint: https://usagge.hipchat.com/v2/room/3729485/notification?auth_token=mySecretToken
  content: '{"color":"green","message":"New package published: * {{ name }}*","notify":true,"message_format":"text"}'
```

#### Multiple notification

```yaml
notify:
  'example-package-1'
     method: POST
     headers: [{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}]
     endpoint: https://usagge.hipchat.com/v2/room/3729485/notification?auth_token=mySecretToken
     content: '{"color":"green","message":"New package published: * {{ name }}*","notify":true,"message_format":"text"}'
  'example-package-2'
     method: POST
     headers: [{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}]
     endpoint: https://usagge.hipchat.com/v2/room/3729485/notification?auth_token=mySecretToken
     content: '{"color":"green","message":"New package published: * {{ name }}*","notify":true,"message_format":"text"}'
  'example-package-3'
     method: POST
     headers: [{'Content-Type': 'application/json'}]
     endpoint: https://usagge.hipchat.com/v2/room/3729485/notification?auth_token=mySecretToken
     content: '{"color":"green","message":"New package published: * {{ name }}*","notify":true,"message_format":"text"}'


```
