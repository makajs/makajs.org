Verdaccio is an plugabble aplication. Currently supports multiple plugins only for [Authentication](auth.md) but there are plans to [improve the plugin system](https://github.com/verdaccio/verdaccio/issues/169). If you are interested to develop your own plugin, read the [development](development.md) section.

## Usage

### Installation

```bash
$> npm install --global verdaccio-activedirectory
```

`verdaccio` as a sinopia fork it has backward compability with plugins that are compatible with `sinopia@1.4.0`. In such case the installation is the same.

    &> npm install --global sinopia-memory
    

### Configuration

Open the `config.yaml` file and update the `auth` section as follows:

The default configuration looks like this, due we use a build-in `htpasswd` plugin by default that you can disable just commenting out the following lines.

```yaml
 htpasswd:
    file: ./htpasswd
    # Maximum amount of users allowed to register, defaults to "+inf".
    # You can set this to -1 to disable registration.
    #max_users: 1000
```

and replacing them with (in case you decide to use a `ldap` plugin.

```yaml
auth:
  activedirectory:
    url: "ldap://10.0.100.1"
    baseDN: 'dc=sample,dc=local'
    domainSuffix: 'sample.local'
```

### Multiple Auth plugins

This is tecnically possible, the plugins order becames important, the the credentials will resolved in order.

```yaml
auth:
  htpasswd:
    file: ./htpasswd
    # Maximum amount of users allowed to register, defaults to "+inf".
    # You can set this to -1 to disable registration.
    #max_users: 1000
  activedirectory:
    url: "ldap://10.0.100.1"
    baseDN: 'dc=sample,dc=local'
    domainSuffix: 'sample.local'
```
